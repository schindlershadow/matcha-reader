"""Convert manga (image folder / CBZ / EPUB) into CrossPoint Reader format.

Replaces the Mokuro-based pipeline (tools/mokuro_convert/). Mokuro infers
panel boundaries by clustering OCR text-box positions, which only
approximates real panels and produces nothing for panels without text. This
tool instead:

  1. Detects actual panel RECTANGLES geometrically (white-gutter grid
     detection -- no ML model required).
  2. Crops each panel and sends it to Gemini (gemini-3.8-flash) asking what
     text/dialogue appears in it, as JSON.
  3. Writes the same panels.idx/panels.dat binary format the device already
     reads, plus page images renamed to a canonical page_NNNN.<ext> sequence
     so the device's natural-sort-based page scan can never misorder pages
     (no dependency on a distributor's arbitrary source filenames).

Page images are copied as-is (JPG/PNG) -- the device renders them directly,
no BMP conversion needed.

Usage:
    export GEMINI_API_KEY=$(cat ~/path/to/gemini.key)
    python3 convert_manga.py --input ./manga_pages/ --output-dir /path/to/sd/manga/Book/

    # Or pass the key file directly (key is read at runtime, never embedded):
    python3 convert_manga.py --input ./manga_pages/ --output-dir ./out/ \\
        --gemini-key-file ./gemini.key

    # Explicit page order, for sources whose filenames don't sort correctly
    # (one source filename per line, in the order pages should be read):
    python3 convert_manga.py --input ./manga_pages/ --output-dir ./out/ \\
        --page-order-file ./order.txt

    # Skip the Gemini OCR pass entirely (panels only, no text/lookup data):
    python3 convert_manga.py --input ./manga_pages/ --output-dir ./out/ --no-ocr

Output (in --output-dir):
    page_0000.jpg, page_0001.jpg, ...   canonical, trivially-sortable page
                                         images (device scans these directly)
    panels/p<page>_<panel>.jpg          cropped panel images for panel-zoom, in their own
                                         subfolder so the book folder holds only page images:
                                         the device walks every entry of the book folder when
                                         opening a book, and a crop per panel dominated that
                                         scan (measured 6499ms for 2396 entries, of which 219
                                         were pages and 974 were crops). The firmware still
                                         reads the older flat layout, so books converted before
                                         this keep working -- re-convert to get the faster open.
    panels.idx / panels.dat             panel layout data
    meta.bin                            book title + author + language (auto-extracted
                                         from source, or set via --title/--author/--language)

Binary format (meta.bin):
    Header (8 bytes):
        uint32  version         (currently 1)
        uint16  titleLen        UTF-8 byte length of title
        uint16  authorLen       UTF-8 byte length of author
    char[]  title               UTF-8 title (titleLen bytes)
    char[]  author              UTF-8 author (authorLen bytes)
    Optional trailer (only present when a language is known):
        uint16  languageLen     UTF-8 byte length of language tag
        char[]  language        UTF-8 BCP-47/ISO-639 tag, e.g. "ja", "en"

    The trailer is appended WITHOUT bumping the version: firmware predating it reads
    exactly the header + title + author and never looks further, so it ignores the extra
    bytes rather than rejecting the file. Newer firmware detects the trailer by checking
    whether any bytes remain after the author. Any future field must follow the same
    rule -- append only, never reorder or resize what comes before.

Binary format (panels.idx):
    Header:
        uint32  version         (currently 1)
        uint32  pageCount
    Per page (pageCount records, 12 bytes each):
        uint32  dataOffset      byte offset into panels.dat
        uint32  dataLength      byte length of this page's data
        uint16  imgWidth        source image width (pixels)
        uint16  imgHeight       source image height (pixels)

Binary format (panels.dat, per page at dataOffset):
    uint8   panelCount
    uint8   reserved
    Per panel (panelCount entries):
        uint16  x, y, w, h        panel bounding box (pixels)
        uint8   textCount         text blocks in this panel
        uint8   reserved
        uint16  translationLen    UTF-8 length of the panel's English translation
        bytes   translation[]     UTF-8 translation (translationLen bytes), empty if none
        -- v3 and later --
        uint16  cropX, cropY, cropW, cropH
                                  the page region the panel's crop image shows (the panel
                                  plus its margin), so a point on a zoomed panel can be
                                  mapped back to page coordinates
        Per text block (textCount entries):
            uint16  x, y, w, h    text block bounding box (pixels)
            uint16  textLen       UTF-8 text length
            bytes   text[]        UTF-8 text (textLen bytes, not null-terminated)
            -- v3 and later --
            uint8   lineCount     printed lines (columns, for vertical text) in the block;
                                  0 when the OCR gave no usable line geometry
            uint8   flags         bit 0: vertical (lines are columns, read top to bottom)
            Per line (lineCount entries), in reading order -- line i is the i-th
            '\n'-separated segment of text[]:
                uint16  x, y, w, h  the line's own bounding box (pixels)

Line boxes let the device find the word under a finger: within a printed line, manga
lettering advances one cell per character (an upright run such as "360" or "!!" sharing
one cell), so a point along the line maps to a character of the block text.

    substantially, they're in the same tier and read horizontally; if not,
