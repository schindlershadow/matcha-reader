# Matcha Reader, a language-learning fork of CrossPoint

A fork of [CrossPoint](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader) e-reader firmware for ESP32 devices (XTEINK X4, X3, X4C, X4-Pro, Papermono, Sticky), built for reading books and comics in a language you are learning. It is set up first for **Japanese** and **Chinese** (Mandarin in simplified or traditional characters, and Cantonese), and gives learners of French, English and other languages the same lookup, sentence-mining and translation tools.

It includes all features of upstream CrossPoint and runs on any supported ESP32 device. You can try it first in the [simulator](https://github.com/eszter007/crosspoint-simulator-ios) — no device needed — on your desktop or as an iPhone app.

### What each learner gets

| | Japanese | Mandarin, simplified | Mandarin, traditional | Cantonese | Other languages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Book tag | `ja` | `zh-CN`, `zh-Hans` | `zh-TW`, `zh-Hant`, `zh-HK` | `yue` | `fr`, `en`, `de`, … |
| Word lookup | Page split into words, conjugations undone | Page split into words by frequency | Same | Same | Word by word, with word-form rules (fullest for French) |
| Reading shown | Kana | Pinyin | Pinyin and zhuyin | Pinyin and jyutping | — |
| Level tag | — | HSK | TOCFL | — | — |
| Dictionary | Jitendex / JMdict, names, grammar | CC-CEDICT | CC-CEDICT + MoE 重編國語辭典 | CC-Canto + CC-CEDICT | Any StarDict |
| Dictionary folder | `dictionaries/jp/` | `dictionaries/zh/` | `dictionaries/zh/` | `dictionaries/yue/` | `dictionaries/<lang>/<name>/` |
| Text layout | Vertical by default | Horizontal | Vertical when the book is right-to-left | As traditional | Horizontal |
| Readings above the text | Furigana from the book, or added with a script | Pinyin added with a script | Pinyin or zhuyin added with a script | — | — |
| Font | Built in; SD font optional | SD font required (Noto Sans SC) | SD font required (Noto Sans TC) | SD font required (Noto Sans TC) | Built in |
| Comics | Manga, lookup in the bubbles | Manhua, same | Manhua, same | Manhua, same | Comics, same |
| Saved sentences | `sentences-ja.csv` | `sentences-zh.csv` | `sentences-zh.csv` | `sentences-yue.csv` | `sentences-<lang>.csv` |

A plain `zh` tag is taken as simplified or traditional by the characters the book uses. What the level, zhuyin and jyutping rows show depends on how the dictionary was built; the ready-made packs and the commands in [Setup](#setup) produce exactly this table.

## Features

### Word lookup, in every language

Look up any word on the page, vertically or horizontally. The page is scanned first, so in Japanese and Chinese the cursor only lands on words that actually have an entry.

Lookup opens on the page itself: the current word is highlighted where it stands, and the definition opens only when you press Look Up. In vertical text the side buttons step word by word down the column and Left and Right jump a column; in horizontal text Left and Right step along the line and the side buttons jump a line. Back returns to the highlighted page, so several words on a page are a few presses apart. The cursor opens mid-page and the scan starts there too, so the half you are looking at is ready first; words it has not reached yet can still be selected, and the highlight moves as soon as the scan arrives. No button labels are drawn over the page — the text would be covered by them.

On a touch device, long-pressing a word on the page opens its definition directly — no setting to turn on, and no cursor to move first. A press that lands between words opens ordinary word selection instead. The panel pages by touch however the reader is set to turn pages, and a tap outside it puts it away.

The definition opens as a panel floating over the page you were reading: the word sits above a divider at the top, the entry fills the middle, and along the bottom the entry's type and dictionary (`Vocab | JMdict`, `Vocab | CC-CEDICT`) sit on the left with a counter on the right. In books the entry is paged a screenful at a time and the counter shows the page; manga scrolls the entry freely and the counter shows your position among the page's words instead.

Reader Settings includes **Word Lookup Font Size** (Tiny, Small, Medium or Large) for adjusting dictionary entry text. See [Setup](#setup) for the dictionary files, and [§6.1](USER_GUIDE.md#61-word-lookup) for how to drive lookup.

</p>

#### Sentence mining

Save a looked-up word together with the sentence it came from, ready to import into Anki. With a definition open, press **Select**, or tap the **+** in the panel's top-right corner on a touch device. The footer shows **Saved** until you move on. It works in every language, in books and in comics.

Each save adds one line to a CSV file per language in the `sentence-mining` folder on the SD card: `sentences-ja.csv`, `sentences-zh.csv`, `sentences-yue.csv`, `sentences-en.csv` and so on. The language is the dictionary's, so a file can be imported into its own deck. Each line holds the word in its dictionary form, its reading (kana for Japanese; pinyin, with zhuyin or jyutping when the dictionary has them, for Chinese), the sentence with the word in bold, the whole dictionary entry, the book, author, date and dictionary, plus tags (`matcha` and the book title).

To import, open the file in Anki with **File → Import**. The first lines of the file tell Anki the layout, so there is nothing to set up. The files only ever grow; import the same file again later and Anki updates the cards it already has instead of adding them twice, because every card carries a stable ID.

A sentence cut off by the end of the page is finished from the next page. The date comes from the device clock, which sets itself whenever the device connects to Wi-Fi. On devices without a clock chip (the X4) a restart loses the time, so the date can lag until the next Wi-Fi connection. Switch on **Power + Up Syncs Clock** in Settings → Controls → Shortcuts to sync the clock from any screen with Power + Side Up.

#### Page translation

Translates the current page to English with Gemini, in the same floating panel as the dictionary, over the page you are reading. Works in a book in any language. Needs Wi-Fi and your own API key; a saved network is joined from inside the panel.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/screenshots/translate-page.png" width="260" alt="A page translation in the floating panel"></p>

### For Japanese learners

**Vertical text.** Japanese books are detected from their metadata and set vertically: right-to-left columns, kinsoku line breaking, sesame emphasis marks, and furigana beside the kanji. A per-book toggle overrides the detection when you disagree with it, and a second one shows or hides the furigana.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/screenshots/vertical-text.png" width="260" alt="Vertical Japanese text">
  <img src="docs/images/screenshots/horizontal-text.png" width="260" alt="The same passage with vertical text switched off">
</p>
<p align="center"><em>The same passage, Vertical Text on and off</em></p>

**Conjugations resolve to the dictionary form** on their own: 読んで becomes 読む, 食べませんでした becomes 食べる.

**Vocabulary, names and grammar** each come from their own dictionary. A word listed in both vocabulary and grammar shows both entries: in a book as separate pages (grammar first for short function words like こと), and below each other when you tap a word in manga. If the book itself annotated a reading, the entry opens with "In this book: はやし" and remembers it for the rest of the book.

**A word broken across a page break still resolves.** The lookup reads a few characters past the end of the page, so the half you can see finds the whole word; the highlight stays on the page and covers only the characters that are there.

**Furigana for books that have none.** The device shows the furigana a book carries; it does not work readings out itself. `tools/furigana_ruby/add_furigana_ruby.py --ai` adds them to an EPUB on your computer, reading each word in context with Gemini under your own key, and keeps any furigana the book already has. See [Setup](#setup).

**A font is built in.** The built-in Noto covers the common Japanese characters; an SD font (Noto Sans or Serif JP) looks better and fills in rare kanji.

### For Chinese learners

Chinese books get the same scan-based lookup as Japanese: each run of characters is split into dictionary words and the cursor lands only on words with an entry. The split weighs the whole run by word frequency rather than grabbing the longest match at each step, so 结婚的和尚未结婚的 reads 和 + 尚未, not 和尚. There is no conjugation to undo, so a word like 說話 or 中国 resolves as soon as it is on the page.

The three kinds of Chinese book differ in what the entry shows and which files they read:

- **Mandarin in simplified characters** (`zh-CN`, `zh-Hans`). The entry opens with pinyin and, with the simplified pack, the word's **HSK** level. Books open horizontally. Font: Noto Sans SC.
- **Mandarin in traditional characters** (`zh-TW`, `zh-Hant`, `zh-HK`). The entry shows pinyin and **zhuyin**, the word's **TOCFL** level, and under the English entry a monolingual one from the Ministry of Education's 重編國語辭典. A book whose EPUB declares right-to-left page progression (Taiwanese novels, as a rule) opens in vertical columns, and 。，、 sit centred in their square, as Taiwanese print sets them. Font: Noto Sans TC.
- **Cantonese** (`yue`). Reads its own dictionary folder, built from CC-Canto and CC-CEDICT together, because Cantonese has words a Mandarin dictionary does not list. The entry shows pinyin and **jyutping**. Laid out like a traditional-Chinese book. Saved sentences go to `sentences-yue.csv`.

Common to all three:

- **Both scripts are indexed**, so a traditional dictionary serves a simplified book and the other way round, and the entry shows the other form (`說話 / 说话`).
- **The common sense comes first**: entries are ranked by a frequency list. Proper nouns can go to their own names dictionary and a grammar list to the grammar slot, exactly as for Japanese. Example sentences with translations come from Tatoeba.
- **A wrong or missing language tag is caught.** A book is recognised from its text the first time it opens, and **Reader Settings → Book Language** re-tags any book by hand (Auto, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Cantonese), so a Chinese EPUB labelled `en` still gets its dictionary, font and layout.
- **Pinyin above the text** works the way furigana does: the book carries it. The device does not work pinyin out itself, so the EPUB is prepared once on your computer: `tools/pinyin_ruby/add_pinyin_ruby.py` adds pinyin (or zhuyin) ruby to every word, optionally skipping the commonest words, and the **Pinyin / Zhuyin** toggle in Reader Settings (called **Furigana** for a Japanese book) shows or hides it on the device. With `--ai` the reading of a character that has several (石 *shí* or *dàn*, 說 *shuō* or *shuì*) is chosen in context by Gemini rather than taken from the first dictionary entry.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/screenshots/pinyin-ruby.png" width="260" alt="A page of 紅樓夢 (Project Gutenberg) with pinyin above every character, added by the pinyin script with --ai"></p>
<p align="center"><em>紅樓夢 after the pinyin script with <code>--ai</code>, Pinyin / Zhuyin switched on</em></p>

- **Vertical Text** in Reader Settings overrides the layout either way, per book.
- **An SD font is required.** The built-in CJK glyphs are the common Japanese set, so a Chinese book without one shows empty boxes for everyday characters such as 这, 说 or 們.
- **The interface** can be switched to 简体中文 or 繁體中文.

### For learners of other languages

Every other language is looked up in ordinary StarDict dictionaries, picked by the book's language tag; nothing needs converting. A word on the page is rarely in the shape the dictionary lists it under, so a lookup that misses is retried with word-form rules:

- **Every language:** a word at the start of a sentence keeps its accents and still resolves (`École` finds `école`).
- **French** has the fullest rules. `l'eau` looks up `eau`, `journaux` finds `journal`, `heureuse` finds `heureux`, and the regular conjugations resolve to the infinitive (`parlaient` → `parler`, `mangeons` → `manger`, `finissent` → `finir`). The same coverage extends to `-eindre`/`-aindre`/`-oindre` verbs (`éteignit` finds `éteindre`, `craignait` finds `craindre`), `-aître` verbs (`connaissons` finds `connaître`), `-uire` verbs (`conduisit` finds `conduire`), and adverbs formed from an adjective (`lentement` finds `lent`). A literary verb-subject inversion like `songeai-je` or `pense-t-il` splits into two selectable words (`songeai`/`je`, `pense`/`il`), while a genuine compound like `rendez-vous` or `grand-mère` still selects as one word.
- **English and everything else** fall back to plurals and verb endings.

Irregular verbs that share no stem with their infinitive — and a verb's irregular passé simple, like `connus` or `naquit` — need a `.syn` file in the dictionary folder; see [docs/dictionary.md](docs/dictionary.md).

### Manga, manhua and comics

Panels are detected at conversion time, along with their text and translations, so lookup and translation work offline and appear instantly. Move panel by panel in reading order, each one scaled to fill the screen. The language is set when you convert (`--language ja`, `zh`, `yue`, `fr`, …), and it decides which dictionary the speech bubbles are looked up in.

**Look up any word right in the picture.** On a touch device, hold a word in a speech bubble and its dictionary entry opens, the same as in a book. With buttons, open Word Lookup and an outline appears around a word on the page; the page-turn keys move it word by word and Confirm looks it up. The outline leaves the word readable, and it works on the full page and on zoomed or rotated panels. Books converted before this feature need converting again to get it; see [§6.6](USER_GUIDE.md#66-manga-manhua-and-comics).

**Rotate Panels** (Settings, on by default) turns a panel whose shape does not match the screen, so a wide panel fills the display and you turn the device to read it. Switch it off to keep every panel upright inside the current orientation. **Panels Only** skips the full page overviews. Both are covered in [§6.6](USER_GUIDE.md#66-manga-manhua-and-comics).

**Refresh Frequency** counts every panel step as a page, so at **1 page** each panel gets a full refresh and no ghost of the previous panel stays behind.

Convert with the [browser tool](https://eszter007.github.io/matcha-reader-tools/), or see [Converting manga](#converting-manga).

### Library

Every book on the card as a cover grid, at any depth. Covers and titles come from the book's own metadata on first
visit, with progress as a badge. Manga sits beside EPUBs. A **Shelves** tab lists folders that contain books.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/screenshots/library.png" width="260" alt="Library grid with manga and EPUB covers side by side, under the Library tabs"></p>

CrossPoint's own library screen is still here if you prefer it: an indexed list with title and author search across
thousands of books, sorted by title, author or when they were added. **Settings → Display → Library** gathers the library
settings on one screen, starting with the view switch: **Matcha Covers** (the default) or **CrossPoint List**.

### Cover Grid home, with tabs

The **Cover Grid** theme (the default on touch devices; **Settings → Display → UI Theme** elsewhere) puts a tab bar along
the bottom that stays put as you move between Home, Library, File Transfer, Insights and Settings. The tab you are in is
drawn filled. Nothing opens "on top" any more, so there is no stack to back out of.

On a button-only device the bar is part of one navigation ring rather than a separate thing to reach: **Up/Down** walk a
screen's own tabs, then its rows, then the bottom bar; **Confirm** steps the tabs at the top and past the last one drops
into the bar; **Left/Right** step the tabs at the top and move along the bar, and **Confirm** on the tab you are already
in hands the cursor back to the first tab at the top. A grey outline marks whatever the cursor is on. Details in
[§3.1.1](USER_GUIDE.md#311-tabs-and-button-navigation-cover-grid-theme).

The other themes have no bottom bar, and there **Left/Right** are the same as **Up/Down** everywhere, as the button
hints say: on a screen's tabs they move on into its rows, and **Confirm** is what steps to the next tab.

Covers are built in the background, so the grid appears at once with titles standing in for artwork the device has not
made yet and each cover replaces its own title as it finishes. A button press interrupts the work instead of queueing
behind it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/screenshots/tab-home.png" width="150" alt="Home tab: the cover grid">
  <img src="docs/images/screenshots/library.png" width="150" alt="Library tab, with Books, Shelves, OPDS and Files">
  <img src="docs/images/screenshots/tab-transfer.png" width="150" alt="File Transfer tab">
  <img src="docs/images/screenshots/insights.png" width="150" alt="Insights tab, with a tab per language">
  <img src="docs/images/screenshots/tab-settings.png" width="150" alt="Settings tab">
</p>

The OPDS catalogs and the SD browser live inside the Library there, as the **OPDS** and **Files** tabs beside
**Books** and **Shelves**. On the other themes they stay their own entries on the home menu.

Long press a cover, on the home grid, in the Library or inside a shelf, for **View Stats**, **Mark as Read** /
**Mark as Unread** and **Delete**. On button-only devices, hold **Confirm** on the selected cover. Only the direction that changes something is offered: a finished book has no "Mark as Read". Delete asks
first, and takes the book's reading cache with it.

Swipe down from the top edge for the control centre: brightness and warmth, then round buttons for dark mode, a screen
refresh, orientation, touch controls and the light. Each button names what tapping it does rather than reporting a state.

### Reading stats

Streak, minutes this week, books finished, total time, and a calendar of the days you read. Recorded as you go, every few minutes and again when you close a book, so a flat battery costs you minutes rather than the whole session.

Tabs across the top split the same numbers by language: **All**, then one per language the device has seen. Long press a book in the Library for its own sessions, total time, average session, words looked up, sentences saved and calendar.

Finishing a book opens a celebration screen: which book this is for you overall and in its language ("Your 12th book · 3rd in 日本語"), your reading time, the days it took, your streak, and the words you looked up and sentences you saved in it. Below that, the next books in the same folder and **Go to Home**. Every book type gets it: EPUB, TXT, Markdown, XTC and manga.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/screenshots/insights.png" width="240" alt="Insights with streak, stat cards and calendar">
  <img src="docs/images/screenshots/book-stats.png" width="240" alt="Per-book stats for one book">
  <img src="docs/images/screenshots/end-of-book.png" width="240" alt="End-of-book screen with the book's stats and the next books">
</p>

Manga counts the same as EPUBs. Language comes from the book, so set `--language` when you convert manga. Details and the known limits are in [§7](USER_GUIDE.md#7-reading-stats).

### Transparent sleep screen

A wallpaper laid over the page you were reading, so the book shows through instead of being covered. Set **Sleep Screen** to **Transparent** and drop 480x800 BMPs into `.sleep/transparent/` on the card. Images with plenty of white space work best, since anything solid hides the text under it. See [§3.7](USER_GUIDE.md#37-sleep-screen).

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/screenshots/sleep-screen-transparent.png" width="260" alt="Sleep wallpaper over the page text, which stays readable behind it"></p>

### Also in this fork

- Per-book reader settings: font, size, spacing, margins and orientation are remembered per book
- A built-in CJK fallback font, so the odd kanji in a non-Japanese book still renders (common Japanese characters only: a Chinese book needs the SD font from Setup, which Home also picks up for Chinese titles)
- **Optimize EPUB** on upload: splits single-file Japanese novels into real chapters with a working table of contents, and fits images to the screen as dithered 1-bit BMPs
- More of the book's own CSS respected: headings sized as headings, line spacing, page breaks, boxed asides, and rules written as `.callout p`
- Drop caps: a chapter opening styled with `::first-letter { font-size: … }` gets the enlarged initial the book asked for, with the first few lines wrapping around it
- **Use Book Margins** (Text Settings > Layout, on by default) keeps the indents a book sets for itself, so epigraphs and long quotations stay inset. Turn it off and those blocks sit flush with the body text. Horizontal books only: in vertical text, Layout lists just Line Spacing, Character spacing and Screen Margin
- Instant image page turns, since the next image decodes in the background
- From upstream, and working in vertical and horizontal books alike: SD-card plugins (**Settings → Plugins**, see [docs/sd-plugins.md](docs/sd-plugins.md)), a haptic tap on touch devices with a motor (**Settings → Controls → Haptic Feedback**), and a **Paragraph Indentation** setting (Text Settings > Layout; horizontal text)
- Next-book suggestions at the end of EPUB, TXT/Markdown, XTC and manga books
- A file browser that shows everything on the card, with unsupported files greyed out rather than hidden
- Fully localised, in all the languages CrossPoint ships

## Setup

> No Python needed. [**Matcha Reader Tools**](https://eszter007.github.io/matcha-reader-tools/) converts dictionaries, fonts and manga in your browser and hands back a zip laid out for the card. Files stay on your machine, except manga OCR, where panels go to Gemini under your own key. ([source](https://github.com/eszter007/matcha-reader-tools))

On devices with external RAM enabled in CrossPoint, copy `.ttf`, `.otf`, or `.ttc` files to the SD card and select them as reader fonts. Put one file in `/fonts/` or `/.fonts/`, or put one family's files in a subfolder. See the [SD card font guide](./docs/sd-card-fonts.md) for the folder layout and styles.

On other devices, convert the font to `.cpfont` first. `.cpfont` files also work on devices with external RAM enabled and have better performance. No firmware reflash is needed to add fonts.

To make `.cpfont` files:

**1. Flash the firmware** with the standard CrossPoint process, see the [upstream docs](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader). Take the build for your device from [this repository's releases](https://github.com/eszter007/matcha-reader/releases) — not upstream's:

| Device | Asset |
| --- | --- |
| X3, and X4 (old) | `x4old-x3-firmware.bin` |
| X4C (new) | `x4c-firmware.bin` |
| X4 Pro | `x4pro-firmware.bin` |
| Sticky | `sticky-firmware.bin` |
| Papermono | `papermono-firmware.bin` |

Once flashed, **Settings → Update** checks this repository's releases and downloads the asset matching your device, so an update keeps the Matcha features rather than replacing them with stock CrossPoint. Pre-releases (nightlies) are never offered over the air — install those by flashing.

**2. Install dictionaries.** Word lookup needs at least a vocabulary dictionary for each language you read. A book's language tag picks the folder, so you can keep several languages on one card and never choose by hand.

```
dictionaries/
  jp/                          # Japanese
    vocab.idx    vocab.dat    vocab.spx      # vocabulary (required)
    names.idx    names.dat    names.spx      # names (recommended)
    grammar.idx  grammar.dat  grammar.spx    # grammar reference (optional)
  zh/                          # Mandarin, simplified and traditional books alike
    vocab.idx    vocab.dat    vocab.spx    vocab.title    # vocabulary (required)
    names.idx    names.dat    names.spx    names.title    # proper nouns (optional)
    grammar.idx  grammar.dat  grammar.spx  grammar.title  # grammar patterns (optional)
  yue/                         # Cantonese
    vocab.idx    vocab.dat    vocab.spx    vocab.title
  en/your_dictionary_name/     # English, StarDict files
  fr/your_dictionary_name/     # French, StarDict files
```

The folder can also be called `.dictionaries/`, which hides it from the file browser. It works exactly the same.

##### Japanese

Japanese always uses the converted files in `dictionaries/jp/`. Convert them from [Jitendex](https://github.com/stephenmk/Jitendex), [JMnedict](https://github.com/JMdictProject) or any other Yomitan dictionary with the [browser tool](https://eszter007.github.io/matcha-reader-tools/), or the script:

```bash
python3 tools/dict_convert/convert_jmdict.py \
  --input jitendex-yomitan.zip \
  --output-dir /path/to/sd/dictionaries/jp/    # add --name names / --name grammar for the others
```

To add furigana to a Japanese book that has none, annotate the EPUB once before copying it to the card. Readings depend on context, so this always goes through Gemini (the book's text is sent to it under your own key):

```bash
python3 tools/furigana_ruby/add_furigana_ruby.py --ai --gemini-key-file gemini.key book.epub book-furigana.epub
```

##### Chinese: Mandarin, simplified or traditional

Ready-made packs come from the [`dictionaries-zh` release](https://github.com/eszter007/matcha-reader/releases/tag/dictionaries-zh): unzip the **simplified** or the **traditional** one onto the card so that it holds `dictionaries/zh/`. Install one, not both: they share the folder. Either pack serves books in both scripts, because every entry is indexed under both forms; they differ in what the entry shows.

| | Simplified pack | Traditional (Taiwanese) pack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reading | Pinyin | Pinyin and zhuyin |
| Level tag | [HSK 3.0](https://github.com/ivankra/hsk30) | [TOCFL](https://github.com/ivankra/tocfl) |
| Entries | CC-CEDICT | CC-CEDICT, with the MoE 重編國語辭典 entry under it |
| Ranked by | [jieba](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba) `dict.txt` (MIT) | jieba `dict.txt.big`, which carries traditional forms too |
| Example sentences | Simplified | Traditional |

To build your own, the same script takes `--lang zh`. Sources: the raw [CC-CEDICT](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cc-cedict) file, the Taiwan Ministry of Education's 重編國語辭典 as the [g0v `dict-revised.json`](https://github.com/g0v/moedict-data), or a Yomitan build such as [CC-CEDICT for Yomitan](https://github.com/MarvNC/cc-cedict-yomitan). The first command below is the simplified set, the second the Taiwanese one:

```bash
python3 tools/dict_convert/convert_jmdict.py --lang zh \

`--frequency` puts the common sense of a word first and makes the page segment by frequency; any list with one word per row works, and a word missing from it takes the rank of its other-script form, so a simplified list still ranks a traditional book. `--split-names` sends proper nouns to the names dictionary.

Optional extras, for either set:

- **Example sentences** from [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/en/downloads): download the Chinese–English sentence pairs and add `--examples "Sentence pairs in Mandarin Chinese-English.tsv"`, and every entry of two or more characters shows up to two short sentences with their translations.
- **A grammar reference** goes in the grammar slot from any two-column file, pattern and explanation, with `--format tsv --name grammar`; the [Chinese Grammar Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/) is CC BY-NC-SA, so that one is for your own card only.
- **Pinyin above the text itself**: annotate the EPUB once before copying it to the card.

  ```bash
  python3 tools/pinyin_ruby/add_pinyin_ruby.py --cedict cedict_1_0_ts_utf-8_mdbg.txt \
    --frequency dict.txt --skip-top 1500 book.epub book-pinyin.epub   # --zhuyin for bopomofo
  ```

  Add `--ai --gemini-key-file gemini.key` to have each character's reading picked in context. The book's text is sent to Gemini under your own key, sentence by sentence; a reading is used only when CC-CEDICT lists it for that character, and the dictionary's is kept otherwise.

##### Chinese: Cantonese

Cantonese is its own language with its own words, so a `yue` book reads `dictionaries/yue/` instead. Build it from [CC-Canto](https://cantonese.org/download.html), which holds the Cantonese-only vocabulary with jyutping, merged with CC-CEDICT for everything the two languages share, and the readings file so the shared words carry jyutping too:

```bash
python3 tools/dict_convert/convert_jmdict.py --lang yue \
  --input cccanto-webdist.txt --input cedict_1_0_ts_utf-8_mdbg.txt \
  --jyutping cccedict-canto-readings.txt --output-dir /path/to/sd/dictionaries/yue/
```

The converter writes the `.spx` sparse index that makes lookups fast itself; only a copy of the script run outside the repository needs `python3 scripts/gen_dict_spx.py` on the folder afterwards. CC-CEDICT is CC BY-SA; the MoE dictionary is CC BY-ND and is shortened for the screen without changing its wording; Tatoeba sentences are CC BY.

##### Other languages

Every other language uses plain StarDict, with no conversion: put each dictionary in `dictionaries/<lang>/<name>/`, using the language shorthand (`de` for German, `en` for English, `fr` for French, and so on). A book tagged with that language then selects it automatically.

You can put several dictionaries in one language, each in its own folder (`en/collins/`, `en/wiktionary/`). A lookup checks all of them, up to four, and shows every entry it finds one after another: page past the end of one dictionary's entry and the next dictionary's follows, with the footer naming the dictionary and its place (`Collins (1/2)`). The dictionary picked in Settings comes first if it is one of them, then the rest by folder name. Saving a sentence records the dictionary whose entry is on screen.

The dictionary you pick in Settings is also the fallback, used when the book has no language or no folder matches it. Reader Settings shows which dictionary a book reads first.

**3. Install a font for Japanese or Chinese.**

| You read | Font | Needed? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Japanese | Noto Sans JP / Noto Serif JP | Optional: the built-in Noto handles Japanese, a dedicated font looks better and adds rare kanji |
| Mandarin, simplified | Noto Sans SC / Noto Serif SC | Required |
| Mandarin, traditional; Cantonese | Noto Sans TC / Noto Serif TC (or HK) | Required |

Chinese needs one because the built-in CJK glyphs are the common Japanese set: a Chinese book without an SD font shows empty boxes for everyday characters such as 这, 说 or 們. With only a Japanese font on the card, Chinese renders in Japanese glyph shapes.

Convert any TTF or OTF with the [browser tool](https://eszter007.github.io/matcha-reader-tools/) and put the result in `.fonts/<Family>/<Family>_<size>.cpfont` — one file per point size, and the size in the filename is the size offered in Text Settings. **Reader Settings → Text Settings → Manage Fonts** (the last row of the font list) downloads ready-made ones; the Noto Sans and Serif JP, SC and TC cuts appear there once the next font release is published, until then convert them with the browser tool. An SD card CJK font also fills in rare characters elsewhere, such as dictionary entries and book titles on Home and in the Library.

Some folder names pair a font with an entry that is already in the list instead of adding one of their own: `NotoSansJP` / `NotoSerifJP`, `NotoSansSC` / `NotoSerifSC` and `NotoSansTC` / `NotoSerifTC` (or `…HK`) become the Japanese, simplified-Chinese and traditional-Chinese halves of **Noto Sans** / **Noto Serif**, picked by the book's language, and a `…Extended` name widens the font it is named after. A paired font's sizes are offered on the entry it pairs with, so a book that font carries can be read at any size you install — put `NotoSansJP_20.cpfont` on the card and 20 pt appears under Noto Sans. A book it does not carry (an English one, for a Japanese font) renders at the nearest size the main font ships instead.

**4. Switch the interface language** (optional). The menus can be set to 日本語, 简体中文 or 繁體中文, among others, under **Settings → System → Language**. The Chinese ones come as language packs: put the pack from the release in `/.crosspoint/lang/` first. A Chinese interface keeps the SD font loaded for the menus, so install the font before switching.

**5. Set up translation** (optional). Get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and save it as `/system/gemini.key` on the card. A hidden `/.system/` folder works too.

Using all of it: [§6 of the User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md#6-language-learning-features).

## Converting manga

The [browser tool](https://eszter007.github.io/matcha-reader-tools/) needs no local setup. As a script:

```bash
pip install ultralytics huggingface_hub Pillow
export GEMINI_API_KEY=$(cat /path/to/gemini.key)

python3 tools/manga_convert/convert_manga.py \
  --input /path/to/manga.cbz \
  --output-dir /path/to/sd/manga/MangaTitle/ \
  --language ja \
  --x4
```

Set `--language` on every book. It splits your reading time by language, and it tells the OCR pass which language to expect. Most manga carries no language of its own. The tag is read at conversion time, so a book converted without it counts as unknown until you convert it again.

`--input` takes an image folder, `.cbz`, `.zip`, `.epub` or PDF. The flags worth knowing:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--x4` / `--x3` | Scale to the device screen. Smaller files, faster page turns, nothing lost. |
| `--mono` | 1-bit dithered BMP. Good for line art, less so for heavy screentone. |
| `--no-ocr` | Panel boxes only, no Gemini calls, no text or translations. |
| `--ltr` | Read panels left-to-right, for western comics and strips. Default is manga order. |
| `--trim-margins` | Crop the blank paper border and page number off scanned pages. |
| `--webtoon` | Vertical-scroll manhwa or webcomic. Re-cuts the strip into screen-shaped pages. |
| `--yonkoma` | 4-koma strips: read each column top to bottom, then the column to its left. |
| `--no-yonkoma-detect` | Don't recognize 4-koma pages on their own (see below). |
| `--max-pages N` | Convert the first N pages as a cheap test. |
| `--title` / `--author` | Override metadata. |
| `--language` | Book language tag. See above. |

Panels are found with a YOLO model trained on Manga109 ([leoxs22/manga-panel-detector-yolo26n](https://huggingface.co/leoxs22/manga-panel-detector-yolo26n)), falling back to a white-gutter heuristic without `ultralytics`. Gemini then reads and translates each panel.

Western comics work too. Pass `--ltr` so panels within a row are walked left-to-right. The panel detector was trained on manga but handles strip layouts well; page turn direction is a device setting (Reverse page turn), not a conversion one.

OCR follows `--language`, so it works on any of them. The prompt names the language it should expect, which is what stops the model hallucinating Japanese out of a German speech bubble, and a book already in English gets transcription without a pointless English-to-English translation. Set the tag even if you don't care about reading stats.

Yonkoma (4-koma) pages are recognized one by one: a page whose panels form two or more side-by-side strips (three or more equal-height panels sharing their left and right edges) is read strip by strip, so the 4-koma extras bound into an ordinary volume come out right without any flag. A strip panel the detector cut in two is merged back. For a whole book of strips that detection misses, use `--yonkoma`. A 4-koma page is columns of four panels, read down one column and then down the next, where ordinary manga reads across the page. Without the flag the two strips are interleaved: panel 1, the top panel of the *other* strip, panel 2, and so on. The flag swaps the axes of the ordering rule — a tier becomes a column — so a title page whose left half is one full-height illustration beside a strip of four still comes out right, the illustration being a column of its own. Columns run right to left, or left to right with `--ltr`.

Manhwa and other vertical-scroll webcomics need `--webtoon`. A webtoon is one continuous strip, and distributors ship it pre-sliced into fixed-height tiles whose cuts land wherever the slicer's counter reached — often through a face. This reassembles the strip and re-cuts it at the artwork's own gutters into pages shaped to your screen, so no page opens or closes mid-panel. Panels are then the art blocks between gutters, read top to bottom, and the manga panel detector is skipped: it looks for bordered rectangles in a grid and there are none. A 48-tile chapter came out as 42 pages filling 90% of the screen on average.

Add `--trim-margins` for anything scanned from print. It crops the paper border away before panels are detected, which both fills the screen and measurably improves detection: a Moomin page that came back as 9 panels untrimmed, with one whole strip undivided, split into all 11 once the margin was gone.

The output is a folder of images, panel crops and three small index files. Drop it anywhere on the card, the Library finds any folder containing `panels.idx`.

## Building from source

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/eszter007/matcha-reader.git
cd matcha-reader
git submodule update --init --recursive   # if you cloned without --recursive
pio run              # build
pio run -t upload    # flash
```

Same PlatformIO setup as upstream. Development notes are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), the on-card cache formats in [docs/file-formats.md](docs/file-formats.md).

### Running without a device

The [simulator](https://github.com/eszter007/crosspoint-simulator-ios) builds Matcha from these same sources and renders the e-ink panel for you. It runs two ways:

- **Desktop** (macOS or Linux/WSL) through PlatformIO, in an SDL2 window.
- **iPhone**, as an app built with CMake and Xcode, with the panel taking real touch input. macOS only — there is no way to build an iOS app from Linux or Windows.

It is not limited to one board. `-DSIMULATOR_DEVICE=` selects the target, defaulting to `x4pro`, with `x4`, `x3`, `x4classic`, `sticky` and `papermono` matching the PlatformIO envs, and `-DSIMULATOR_DISPLAY=uc8179|uc8279` overriding the panel controller. That makes it the practical way to check a change on hardware you do not own — the touch and Home-key boards in particular.

From the simulator checkout, point it at this repository. The path must be absolute — a relative one resolves against `ios/` rather than the simulator's root and fails with "No firmware at ...":

```bash
cmake -S ios -B build-matcha -DCROSSPOINT_FIRMWARE_ROOT="$HOME/Projects/matcha-reader"
cmake --build build-matcha
```

## Compatibility with upstream

This fork tracks upstream CrossPoint and merges new releases. Nearly everything is additive: new libraries (`lib/Dict/`, `lib/MangaPanel/`), new activities (word lookup, translation, manga reader) and the vertical text engine. Existing files see only auto-detection and menu wiring, so merges stay cheap.
